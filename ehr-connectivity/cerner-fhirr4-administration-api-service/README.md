# Cerner FHIR Administration API Service

This pre-built service provides an API for administering Cerner FHIR resources. It is built using [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) and uses [Cerner's FHIR API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/health/millennium-platform-apis/mfrap/r4_overview.html) to interact with Cerner's electronic health record system.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this service, you'll need to have Ballerina (Refer compatibility to install the relevant version) installed on your machine. If you are trying out with the Cerner FHIR Sandbox, you have to create an application and obtain an client key and public key of the Cerner FHIR server in order to access their FHIR API. Refer more on app creation on Cerner FHIR sandbox [refer](https://engineering.cerner.com/smart-on-fhir-tutorial/#registration). You have to register a [cerner care account](https://cernercare.com/accounts/create) to access the sandbox and create an application.

### Setup and run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the pre-built service on Cerner administration API.

2. Set the following values in [Config.toml file](https://ballerina.io/learn/provide-values-to-configurable-variables/#provide-via-configuration-files) to do necessary configurations to point to the Cerner FHIR server. The following is a sample configuration structure.

```toml
baseServerHost = "http://localhost:9090"
cernerUrl = "https://fhir-ehr-code.cerner.com/r4/ec2458f2-1e24-41c8-b71b-0e701af7583d"
tokenUrl = "https://authorization.cerner.com/tenants/ec2458f2-1e24-41c8-b71b-0e701af7583d/protocols/oauth2/profiles/smart-v1/token"
clientId = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
scopes = ["system/Patient.read", "system/Patient.write"]
```


| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `baseServerHost` | Base service host of the proxy service|
| `cernerUrl`| Cerner FHIR server url |
| `tokenUrl`| Cerner FHIR server token endpoint url |
| `clientId`| Client ID of the Cerner FHIR application |
| `clientSecret`| Client secret of the Cerner FHIR application |
| `scopes`| Scopes required to access the Cerner FHIR API

> **Note:** If you deploy this to [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/), you can apply configurations through the [config editor](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#manage-ballerina-configurables) in the Choreo console. For more information, see [Deploy in Choreo](#optional-deploy-in-choreo).    

3. Run the project.

    ```ballerina
    bal run
    ```

4. Invoke the APIs.

    Sample request for FHIR patient read:

    ```
    curl --location 'localhost:9090/fhir/r4/Patient/erXuFYUfucBZaryVksYEcMg3'
    ```

## [Optional] Deploy in Choreo

WSO2â€™s Choreo (https://wso2.com/choreo/) is an internal developer platform that redefines how you create digital experiences. Choreo empowers you to seamlessly design, develop, deploy, and govern your cloud native applications, unlocking innovation while reducing time-to-market. You can deploy the healthcare prebuilt services in Choreo as explained below. 

### Prerequisites

If you are signing in to the Choreo Console for the first time, create an organization as follows:

1. Go to https://console.choreo.dev/, and sign in using your preferred method.
2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, Stark Industries.
3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
4. Click Create.
This creates the organization and opens the Project Home page of the default project created for you.

### Steps to Deploy Cerner FHIR pre-built services in Choreo
1. Create Service Component
    * Follow the official documentation to create and configure a service: https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-ballerina-rest-api/#step-1-create-a-service-component. Fill **Provide Repository URL** as "https://github.com/wso2/open-healthcare-prebuilt-services" and select the folder path: ehr-connectivity/cerner-fhirr4-adminstration-api-service. 

    * Click Create. Once the component creation is complete, you will see the component overview page.

2. Build and Deploy
Follow the official documentation to deploy the Cerner FHIR service to your organization https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-ballerina-rest-api/#step-2-build-and-deploy.
